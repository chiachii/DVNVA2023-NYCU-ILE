## hw4: Brushable Scatter Plot Matrix

### About
* Given the dataset has four features for each class, your task involves generating a 4x4 scatter plot grid. Each plot should represent the relationship between two attributes, while plots along the diagonal should display histograms of the respective attribute. 
* Furthermore, your system should enable users to select specific data points within a plot, and these selected points should be emphasized in the other plots for easier analysis. Incorporate color variations, interactive features, or any other design techniques that will enhance data representation.
