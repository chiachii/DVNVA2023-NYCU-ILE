## hw5: Stacked Bar Charts

### About
Craft stacked bar charts to represent the World University Rankings using D3.

**Data Source:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ddosad/timesworlduniversityrankings2024

### Requirements
**Direction of Stack:** You can choose either a vertical or horizontal stacking style.

**Data Representation:** Every stacked bar should represent the total score of a particular university. Within each bar, the scores for different criteria—namely teaching, research, citations, industry income, and international—should be clearly distinguishable.

**Sorting Capability:** Your visualization should enable sorting of universities:

* By overall scores.
* By each individual criterion (teaching, research, citations, industry income, and international).
* Both in ascending and descending orders.
