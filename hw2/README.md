## hw2: Parallel Coordinate Plots

### About
* In this homework, your goal is to implement a web-based parallel coordinate plot to show the iris dataset (the same as your homework #1) using D3. 
* Users should be able to change the order of the axis because the attribute relations are difficult to observe if they are far away. 
* Besides, please render poly-lines (flower samples) in different hues to represent the flower classes (three in total). In this case, the attribute relations of different flowers can be further visualized.

### Note
* The following link is the dataset used in the course: http://vis.lab.djosix.com:2023/data/iris.csv
