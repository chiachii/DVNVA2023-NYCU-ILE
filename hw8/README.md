## hw8: Sankey Diagram

### About
Craft a Sankey Diagram to represent car evaluation data using D3.

**Example code:** https://d3-graph-gallery.com/sankey.html <br>
**Data Source:** https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/19/car+evaluation

### Requirements
- **Data Preparation:** <br> Preprocess the data, ensuring you have valid pairings between attributes for the Sankey Diagram. This might involve calculating frequency counts for each category combination across the mentioned attributes.

- **Sankey Diagram Creation:**
    - Display relationships between the categorical attributes: buying, maintenance, doors, persons, luggage boot, and safety.
    - Ensure that the width of the bands in the Sankey Diagram represents the proportion or count of the dataset that holds that relationship.



- **Design & Interactivity:**
    - **Draggable Nodes:** Users should be able to rearrange the Sankey nodes to declutter the view or focus on specific relationships.
    - **Tooltips:** Implement interactive tooltips that show ratios or raw counts when users hover over the bands in the Sankey diagram.
    - **Visual Design:** Ensure a clear color distinction for different categories, and provide a legend or key that explains any color or symbol used.
